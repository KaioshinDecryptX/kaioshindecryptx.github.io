# **CSS/HTML Projects**

## **Introduction + Description**

Hello, my name is Shawn Wilson and this repository is used to show off a few websites I have created using HTML and CSS.
I had worked on the projects seen in this repository using NotePad and viewing them on Microsoft Edge. Because Edge is not
the primary browser of choice, I had to see if the layout would smoothly transition to, and appear the same on, Chrome and
Firefox. Because the layout was not the same between Edge and Chrome + Firefox, I had to tweak my code. I also had to learn
how to 1) navigate GitHub and 2) figure out how to demo projects all in the same repository.

## **Demo**

In order to demo any of the websites, type, or copy and paste, into the search bar, https://kaioshindecryptx.github.io/folder-name/. 
For each of the projects, the link is as follows:
* https://kaioshindecryptx.github.io/avatar-aang/
* https://kaioshindecryptx.github.io/cerberus-apparel/
* https://kaioshindecryptx.github.io/single-price-grid/
* https://kaioshindecryptx.github.io/cerberus-sign-up/

## **Future Plans**

I plan on adding more project designs as time passes as I am just having fun and want to code in HTML and CSS. JavaScript will be added overtime.

I got the ideas for the projects in this repository through the following link:
